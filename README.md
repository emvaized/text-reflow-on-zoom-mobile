This tool tries to fit all text on page to the screen width after pinch gesture on phone. 
It was created to replicate text reflow feature from Opera Mobile, but in any browser. 

It is available as [Userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emvaized/text-reflow-on-zoom-mobile/refs/heads/main/src/text_reflow_on_zoom.js), and as a browser extension ([Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/text-reflow-on-zoom-mobile/), but you can install it manually in any browser after downloading the latest [release](https://github.com/emvaized/text-reflow-on-zoom-mobile/releases)).

## Possible issues

Since it is my first attempt of implementing this feature, there might be some problems: 

- Some reflowed text elements might be misaligned, if they are positioned inside an element with `align-items:center`

- The script attempts to guess text element which you were zooming into, and scrolls it into view after reflow. But this feature is buggy and doesn't work reliably all the time

- Some text elements might be ignored by the script, for example `div` elements, or `span` elements with `display:inline` rule set. I am yet to figure out how to target these elements without too much performance overhead and unwanted reflows

## Privacy
This tool doesn't collect any private data. It is fully open source, and you can see the code on Github. It requires access to all urls in order to function properly.
